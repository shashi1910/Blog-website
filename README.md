This is a Blog website in which you can upload your blogs.

In order to run this, you will need to follow the following steps:

First we need to start NPM by the command 'npm init'

after that we need to install express.js, nodemon and express-fileupload.
use the 'npm i' command followed by the package names.

In this version, the frontend is functional. I will be making the backend soon.
